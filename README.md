<h1>CSE 578: Group Project - PEARL Implementation &#128293; </h1>

The PEARL visualization tool helps in understanding the human emotions based on the tweets during multiple time intervals and periods, along with interaction with the person’s emotion profile to understand the intricacies present in the mappings and the details. Along with the mappings, to validate the findings and the mappings present for the person’s profile, it presents the linguistic evidence which helps understand why and how the data is present as shown. With the flavor of multi-dimensional analysis, it helps understand the various aspects of the text in the context of the emotions presented by the subject with PEARL. 

## To start the project

* Clone this code to your local machine.
* Using a local server (such as HTTP Simple Server), open the **index.html** file. Tested with Firefox and Python's HTTP Simple Server.
* The code uses preprocessed data files that are stored in the data folder. If you wish to run the preprocessing code then in the Preprocessing folder run the preprocess.py file. For this, you will need to set up a virtual environment with the dependencies mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
